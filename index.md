Description:
Spot Alert, create reminders based on time and location, and not only that, share these reminders with other’s and chat with them.
Many times, we need to do tasks or get them done on a certain time or location (address).


(We’re all juggling a lot these days—and it’s inevitable that we drop the ball on a detail or two from time to time. Sometimes, we just need a reminder, but even making a to-do list isn’t always enough. When you’re on the go, you may not even remember to check your list.
Your smartphone can become your own personal secret weapon—with location-based reminders.)

Some typical cases of using this app are:
Pick up blue cheese when I am in Berkley.
Planning a party, create alerts and share with contacts to pick up stuff whoever reaches first at the said location and simultaneously get updates.
Create alerts for others so they do not forget to do stuff.
Russell – Let me create an alert for Jeremie @ 2pm to send out the holiday mail.
Diana – Let me create an alert for Scott, so he gets a reminder to pick my glasses when he is near the market.

Create reminders based on time and location.
Share reminders with your contacts.
Chat with your contacts in your address book.
